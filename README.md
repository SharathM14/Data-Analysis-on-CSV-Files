# Data-Analysis-on-CSV-Files
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using Python and the Pandas library, a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis. The process begins by loading a CSV file containing sales records, which typically includes columns like Date, Region, Product, Quantity, and Sales. Once the data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, basic exploration is performed to understand its structure, check for missing values, and convert date fields for time-based analysis. Using functions like groupby() and sum(), the data is aggregated to reveal total sales by region, product, or month. These insights are then visualized using Matplotlib or Seaborn to create bar charts and line plots that highlight trends and performance. For example, you can identify which region generated the highest revenue or which product sold the most units. Monthly trends can also be plotted to observe seasonality or growth. This analysis helps build a foundation for more advanced tasks like forecasting or dashboard creation. The final deliverables include a clean Jupyter Notebook with code, charts, and commentary that demonstrate your ability to extract insights from raw data using Python.
